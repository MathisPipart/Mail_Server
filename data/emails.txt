31;a@a.aa;b@b.bb;Follow-up on Exam Preparation;Dear Professor b, \n\nThank you for your detailed response. I have a follow-up question regarding the programming tasks in the exam. Will we need to focus on debugging or optimizing code, or will the tasks mainly involve writing new code from scratch?\n\nAlso, could you let me know if there will be partial credit for incomplete solutions?\n\nThank you again for your guidance.\n\nBest regards,\na;2025-01-07T15:32:40.528031700
32;b@b.bb;a@a.aa;RE: Follow-up on Exam Preparation;Thank you for your questions. Here’s some clarification:\n\n- Programming Tasks: While most tasks will involve writing new code, there may be one or two questions focused on debugging or optimizing existing code. It’s a good idea to review examples of both.\n\n- Partial Credit: Yes, partial credit will be awarded for incomplete solutions that demonstrate correct logic or approach, even if the final result isn’t fully functional. Be sure to comment your code to explain your thought process.\n\nIf you have more questions, don’t hesitate to ask. Good luck with your preparation!\n\nBest regards,\nProfessor b;2025-01-07T15:36:33.365307700

39;a@a.aa;c@c.cc;Exam Preparation Discussion;Hi C, I hope you’re doing well. \nHave you started studying for the Java programming exam? I’m feeling a bit lost with all the material we’ve covered, especially object-oriented programming.\nDo you have any tips or a study plan? Maybe we could go over some topics together?\n\nLet me know!\n\nBest,\nA;2025-01-07T22:07:18.654039
40;c@c.cc;a@a.aa;RE: Exam Preparation Discussion;Hi A, I know exactly how you feel, it’s a lot to review.\nI’ve started going through the lecture slides and doing some practice problems, especially with inheritance and polymorphism.\n\nI’d be happy to study together. How about we meet on [Day] at [Time] in the library? We could start with object-oriented programming and move on to collections and exception handling.\n\nLet me know if that works for you!\n\nBest,\nC;2025-01-07T22:08:14.609866
41;a@a.aa;c@c.cc;RE: Exam Preparation Discussion;Hi C, Thanks for getting back to me! \nThat sounds like a great plan. Let’s meet on [Day] at [Time]. I’ll bring my notes, and maybe we can also try the sample questions Professor Smith uploaded to the portal.\nBy the way, have you looked at debugging? I’m not sure how much of that will be on the exam.\n\nLooking forward to our study session!\n\nBest,\nA;2025-01-07T22:08:57.891707500
42;c@c.cc;a@a.aa;RE: Exam Preparation Discussion;Hi A, Perfect, see you then! \nI’ve looked at debugging a little, it’s definitely worth practicing. The professor mentioned there might be a couple of questions on it. I’ll bring a few examples we can work on together.\nAlso, don’t forget to check out Week 6’s lecture slides. They’re really helpful for exception handling.\n\nLet’s tackle this exam prep together!\n\nBest,\nC;2025-01-07T22:09:44.690740500
